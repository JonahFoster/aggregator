<content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We face Arkansas tonight at 7:45pm on ESPN+/SECN+. We should see some good gymnastics as both teams are coming off their best scoring meets of the year with Arkansas getting an upset win over then #8 LSU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few things to look for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a few weeks the ranking will switch over to the National Qualifying Score which requires us to count three away meets. Most of our meets have been at home so these early away meets will count for quite a while. Our first away meet was our worst score of the season, we need a good score tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We improved our Vaults last week with our National ranking in that event improving from #8 to #6. Our competition for the National championship is #1 Oklahoma who is top 3 in each event. We need to keep improving our Vaults if we want to have a shot to defeat them. If our vault doesn&amp;#39;t consistently get to over 49.4+ our prospects against Oklahoma are dim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are very deep on floor but have only had one meet where we scored the type of top score we are capable of. As a result we are only ranked #4 in this event. We need to start consistently getting those top 49.6 type of scores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/UnDosTresPescao&quot;&gt; /u/UnDosTresPescao &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaGators/comments/10skc2s/gymnastics_2_florida_vs_18_arkansas/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaGators/comments/10skc2s/gymnastics_2_florida_vs_18_arkansas/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
